# MonitorNap Code Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the stability, cleanup, refactor, and improvement work performed on the MonitorNap codebase.

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

### 1. Import Organization & Cleanup
- **Fixed**: Removed duplicate imports (win32api, win32gui were imported twice)
- **Improved**: Organized imports by category (standard library, third-party, local)
- **Added**: Type hints imports for better code safety
- **Result**: Cleaner, more maintainable import structure

### 2. Error Handling Enhancement
- **Fixed**: Replaced bare `except Exception:` blocks with specific exception types
- **Improved**: Better error messages with context
- **Examples**:
  - `except (json.JSONDecodeError, IOError, OSError)` for config loading
  - `except (OSError, PermissionError, FileNotFoundError)` for registry operations
  - `except (AttributeError, OSError)` for DPI awareness setting

### 3. Code Structure Refactoring
- **Created**: `monitor_controller.py` - Extracted MonitorController and OverlayWindow classes
- **Created**: `ui_components.py` - Extracted UI widget classes for better modularity
- **Benefit**: Reduced main file size from 1300+ lines to ~800 lines
- **Result**: Better separation of concerns and maintainability

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Optimized**: Reduced inactivity check frequency from 1s to 2s intervals
- **Added**: Caching for expensive operations (cursor position, window checks)
- **Implemented**: Smart caching with configurable durations:
  - Cursor position: 500ms cache
  - Window checks: 1s cache
- **Result**: Reduced CPU usage while maintaining responsiveness

### 5. Type Safety & Documentation
- **Added**: Comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase
- **Added**: Detailed docstrings for all classes and methods
- **Improved**: Function signatures with proper return types
- **Result**: Better IDE support, fewer runtime errors, improved maintainability

### 6. Testing Framework
- **Created**: `test_monitornap.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- **Created**: `run_tests.py` - Test runner with dependency checking
- **Coverage**: Tests for ConfigManager, logging, registry operations, UI components
- **Result**: Better code reliability and easier debugging
