**ðŸ“¥ Download:** [monitornap.exe](https://github.com/BDenizKoca/MonitorNap/releases/latest/download/monitornap.exe) (37MB) | [All Releases](https://github.com/BDenizKoca/MonitorNap/releases)

MonitorNap dims your monitors after inactivity using hardware (DDC/CI) and/or a software overlay. It runs in the system tray and supports a global hotkey for "Awake Mode".

## Features
- Per-monitor inactivity detection (cursor and fullscreen checks)
- Hardware dimming via DDC/CI (monitorcontrol)
- Software dimming overlay with color/opacity
- System tray menu, start minimized, and Windows startup registry
- Global hotkey (via `keyboard`) to toggle Awake Mode

## Why I Built It
I was getting blinded by my second monitor but I also get tired of having to constantly switch it on/off so I made this. This enables me to keep my second monitor working without being distracting.

## Known Limitations

- **Monitor index mapping** may differ between Windows enumerations and monitorcontrol; if dimming the wrong screen, use the Display selector to map correctly
- **Fullscreen detection** is heuristic and may not catch all cases (some games/apps may still dim)
- **DDC/CI support varies** by monitor manufacturer - some monitors don't support hardware brightness control
- **USB monitors** typically don't support DDC/CI and will only use software overlay
- **Multiple identical monitors** may be harder to distinguish without using Identify
